## Why use Musicfy ? 
**Musicfy got it all!** Musicfy is easy to use and has the complete features for a basic music discord bot!

**including**: search & select song command, play url (song/playlist) command, play by keywords command, loop/repeat command, vote command, volume adjustment command, Resume/Pause command, etc. 

Checkout the command list and usage on **[guide pages here]() \o/**.

Musicfy will automatically leave voice channel if there is no *non bot user* in the connected voice channel. very cool right???

## What makes Musicfy different ? 
Please try our song **recommendation** command! ^^

You just need to play a song and use `m$recommend` command! Musicfy will search for the most similar (*recommended*) songs & add them to the queue for you. <3

⚠ Recommendation command is limited by quota due to limited resources. Sorry,, we will upgrade the server later in the future :( 
- Daily: 1 quota everyday (Priority use)
- First time use: 8 quotas
- Claim Rewards: Vote and claim! More rewards at weekend! Thanks for supporting! :))

⚠ Recommendation is based on the current playing song. Using `m$recommend` on the same song might result the same recommendation. Please use the command wisely.
We will try to update this later in the future. :(

Have a Musicfy and Smile :))
