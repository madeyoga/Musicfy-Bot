- Queue system!
- Recommendation Command! `m$recommend`
- Support server, 
- Many more to come!

## Why use Musicfy ? 
**Musicfy got it all!** Musicfy has the complete features for a basic music discord bot. 

**including**: search & select song command, play url (song/playlist) command, play by keywords command, loop/repeat command, vote command, volume adjustment command, Resume/Pause command, etc. 

Checkout the command list and usage on **[guide pages here]() \o/**.

Musicfy will automatically leave voice channel if there is no *non bot user* in the connected voice channel. very cool right???

## What makes Musicfy different ? 
Please try our song **recommendation** command! ^^

You just need to play a song and use `m$recommend` command and Musicfy will search for the best recommendation song for you & add them to the queue. <3

Recommendation command is limited by quota due to limited resources. Sorry,, we will upgrade the server later in the future :( 

Have a Musicfy and Smile :))
