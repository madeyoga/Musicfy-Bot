## Why use Musicfy ?
**Musicfy got it all!** Musicfy is easy to use and has the complete features for a basic music discord bot!

**including**: search & select song command, play url (song/playlist) command, play by keywords command, loop/repeat command, vote command, volume adjustment command, Resume/Pause command, etc. 

Checkout the command list and usage on **[guide pages here]() \o/**.

Musicfy will automatically leave voice channel if there is no *non bot user* in the connected voice channel. very cool right???

### Please try our song **recommendation** command! ^^

You just need to play a song from **youtube** and use `m$recommend <number>` command! Musicfy will search for `<number>` most similar (*recommended*) songs & add them to the queue for you. <3

⚠ Recommendation command is limited by quota to prevent abuse & spam! :(

- First time use: You will have 8 quotas.
- Every `m$recommend` will decrease 1 quota in stocks.
- Daily: 1 quota everyday (Priority use).
- Claim Rewards: Vote and claim! More rewards at weekend! Thanks for supporting! :))

⚠ Recommendation is based on the current playing song (currently support only song from youtube). 
Using `m$recommend` on the same song might result the same recommendation. Please use the command wisely.
We will update this later in the future. :(

Have a Musicfy and Smile :))
